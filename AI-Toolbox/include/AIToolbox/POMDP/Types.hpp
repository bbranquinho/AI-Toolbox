         * @name POMDP Value Types
         *
         * POMDP ValueFunctions are complicated. In fact, they are trees. At each
         * belief, you have a particular value function, which also depends on any
         * future observation you might encounter, and must change "value" accordingly.
         * For example, a high valued belief might in the end turn out bad due to
         * repeated "bad" observations. At the same time, for each particular block
         * of values, we want to save the single action that will result in the
         * "actuation" of that particular value.
         *
         * We avoid storing a POMDP ValueFunction as a true tree, mostly due to the
         * fact that most operations like search and update are done on a timestep
         * basis, as in, specific tree depth. Thus the layout is arranged as follows:
         *
         * A VEntry contains the MDP::Values for its specific Belief range. At any
         * belief it can be used to compute, via dot product, the true value of that
         * belief. Together with it, it contains an action index, for the action that
         * results in the actuation of those particular values, and a vector of
         * indeces into the previous VList. There are going to be |O| entries in this
         * vector. Some observations are however impossible from certain beliefs. In
         * theory, those should never be accessed, and those entries will just keep
         * the value of zero to keep things simple. This is also called an alpha
         * vector in the literature, though here it contains more data than just that.
         *
         * A VList is a slice of the final tree with respect to depth, as in all
         * ValueFunctions for a certain timestep t.
         *
         * A ValueFunction is the final tree keeping all VLists together.
         *
         * QFunctions may be defined later, however since POMDP ValueFunctions are already
         * pretty costly in terms of space, in general there's little sense in storing them.
         *
