         * @brief This class implements the QMDP algorithm.
         *
         * QMDP is a particular way to approach a POMDP problem and solve it
         * approximately. The idea is to compute a solution that disregards the
         * partial observability for all timesteps but the next one. Thus, we
         * assume that after the next action the agent will suddenly be able to
         * see the true state of the environment, and act accordingly. In doing
         * so then, it will use an MDP value function.
         *
         * Remember that only the solution process acts this way. When time to
         * act the QMDP solution is simply applied at every timestep, every
         * time assuming that the partial observability is going to last one
         * step.
         *
         * All in all, this class is pretty much a converter of an
         * MDP::ValueFunction into a POMDP::ValueFunction.
         *
         * Although the solution is approximate and overconfident (since we
         * assume that partial observability is going to go away, we think we
         * are going to get more reward), it is still good to obtain a closer
         * upper bound on the true solution. This can be used, for example, to
         * boost bounds on online methods, decreasing the time they take to
         * converge.
         *
         * The solution returned by QMDP will thus have only horizon 1, since
         * the horizon requested is implicitly encoded in the MDP part of the
         * solution.
         * 
         * @tparam M The type of model that is solved by the algorithm.
