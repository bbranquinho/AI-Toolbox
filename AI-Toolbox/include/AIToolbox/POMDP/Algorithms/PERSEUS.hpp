         * @brief This class implements the PERSEUS algorithm.
         *
         * The idea behind this algorithm is very similar to PBVI. The thing
         * that changes is how beliefs are considered; in PERSEUS we only try
         * to find as little VEntries as possible as to ensure that all beliefs
         * considered are improved. This allows to skip generating VEntry for
         * most beliefs considered, since usually few VEntry are responsible
         * for supporting most of the beliefs.
         *
         * At the same time, this means that solutions found by PERSEUS may be
         * *extremely* approximate with respect to the true Value Functions. This
         * is because as long as the values for all the particle beliefs are
         * increased, no matter how slightly, the algorithm stops looking - in
         * effect simply guaranteeing that the worst action is never taken.
         * However for many problems the solution found is actually very good,
         * also given that due to the increased performance PERSEUS can do
         * many more iterations than, for example, PBVI.
         *
         * This method is works best when it is allowed to iterate until convergence,
         * and thus shouldn't be used on problems with finite horizons.
