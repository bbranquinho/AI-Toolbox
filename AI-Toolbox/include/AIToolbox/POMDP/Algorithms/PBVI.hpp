         * @brief This class implements the Point Based Value Iteration algorithm.
         *
         * The idea behind this algorithm is to solve a POMDP Model
         * approximately. When computing a perfect solution, the main problem
         * is pruning the resulting ValueFunction in order to contain only a
         * parsimonious representation. What this means is that many vectors
         * inside can be dominated by others, and so they do not add any
         * additional information, while at the same time occupying memory and
         * computational time.
         *
         * The way this method tries to fix the problem is by solving the Model
         * in a set of specified Beliefs. Doing so results in no need for
         * pruning at all, since every belief uniquely identifies one of the
         * optimal solution vectors (only uniqueness in the final set is
         * required, but it is way cheaper than linear programming).
         *
         * The set of Beliefs are stochastically computed as to cover as much
         * as possible of the belief space, to ensure minimization of the final
         * error. The final solution will thus be correct 100% in the Beliefs
         * that have been selected, and will (possibly) overshoot in
         * non-covered Beliefs.
         *
         * In addition, the fact that we solve only for a fixed set of Beliefs
         * guarantees that our final solution is limited in size, which is
         * useful since even small POMDP true solutions can explode in size
         * with high horizons, for very little gain.
         *
         * There is no convergence guarantee of this method, but the error is
         * bounded.
