         * @brief This class models Experience as a Markov Decision Process.
         *
         * Often an MDP is not known in advance. It is known that it can assume
         * a certain set of states, and that a certain set of actions are
         * available to the agent, but not much more. Thus, in these cases, the
         * goal is not only to find out the best policy for the MDP we have,
         * but at the same time learn the actual transition and reward
         * functions of such a model. This task is called "reinforcement
         * learning".
         *
         * This class helps with this. A naive approach to reinforcement
         * learning is to keep track, for each action, of its results, and
         * deduce transition probabilities and rewards based on the data
         * collected in such a way. This class does just this.
         *
         * This class normalizes an Experience object to produce a transition
         * function and a reward function. The transition function is
         * guaranteed to be a correct probability function, as in the sum of
         * the probabilities of all transitions from a particular state and a
         * particular action is always 1. Each instance is not directly synced
         * with the supplied Experience object. This is to avoid possible
         * overheads, as the user can optimize better depending on their use
         * case. See sync().
         *
         * A possible way to improve the data gathered using this class, is to
         * artificially modify the data as to skew it towards certain
         * distributions.  This could be done if some knowledge of the model
         * (even approximate) is known, in order to speed up the learning
         * process. Another way is to assume that all transitions are possible,
         * add data to support that claim, and simply wait until the averages
         * converge to the true values. Another thing that can be done is to
         * associate with each fake datapoint an high reward: this will skew
         * the agent into trying out new actions, thinking it will obtained the
         * high rewards. This is able to obtain automatically a good degree of
         * exploration in the early stages of an episode. Such a technique is
         * called "optimistic initialization".
         *
         * Whether any of these techniques work or not can definitely depend on
         * the model you are trying to approximate. Trying out things is good!
