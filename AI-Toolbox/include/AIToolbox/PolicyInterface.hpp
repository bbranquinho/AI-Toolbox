     * This class represents an interface that all policies must conform to.
     * The interface is generic as different methods may have very different
     * ways to store and compute policies, and this interface simply asks
     * for a way to sample them.
     *
     * This class is templatized since it works as an interface for both
     * MDP and POMDP policies. In the case of MDPs, the template parameter
     * State is of type size_t, which represents the states from which we are
     * sampling. In case of POMDPs, the template parameter is of type Belief,
     * which allows us to sample the policy from different beliefs.
     *
     * @tparam State This defines the type that is used to sample from the policy.
